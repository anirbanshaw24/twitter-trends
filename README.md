Real time tweitter sentiment analysis

This app fetches the most recent Twitter feed based on the provided search term. Users can select the type of tweets to fetch which are 'Popular', 'Recent' and 'fixed'. Users can also choose the number of tweets to download. Once the 'Search' button is clicked, R downloads the data and plots out the aggregate sentiments of the tweets. The downloaded data can also be inspected from the data table displayed below the 'Search' button.

Please note that downloading large number of tweets will increase the download time.
